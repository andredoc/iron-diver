# Welcome to My Team first ever project

This project has been designed, code and thought by a team of two, Andre Documen and Salvador Rus, during a 7 day week assignment on an Iron Hack Bootcamp context.

The aim of this project was to challenge us to create a working game using only JavaScript, no libraries, no nothing, just Js and our confined abilities create it.
Hope you all enjoy it and try to beat our best score of 660 points.
